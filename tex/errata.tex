\chapter*{Errata}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Errata}
I wanted this document, this almost 200 page document, to be free of
errors. But I should know better by now. This is a list of the errors
I could find before submitting this thesis for printing, there are
probably some I did not find, for which I appologize. The errors were
not corrected since the papers should be an exact copy of the papers
published in the literature. 

\section*{Paper 3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Section 6.5.2, Last sentence: Fig. 6.19 $->$ Fig 6.18
\item Section 6.5.3, Second paragraph: Fig 6.20 $->$ Fig. 6.21
\end{enumerate}
