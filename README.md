# Ph.D thesis

Long ago, in a brain far way, I did a Ph.D thesis. The conclusion of that work
was summarized in a thesis, and, of course, I wrote it in latex. 

This is the source. 

I've used docker to make sure the latex still works, so 

``` sh

cd docker
make
make run-sh
```

In the docker shell, do

``` sh
cd /thesis
make
```
